# Some Technologies I Like

I made this repo to store and share some of the technologies and tools I like. I'll upload new things here all the time. I can also create new categories and group the posts when the number of posts increased.

## MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB is a document based NoSQL database for high volume data storing. You can check further details [here](https://www.mongodb.com/)

MongoDB Atlas is a cloud MongoDB database for scalable, modern web applications. MongoDB Atlas also offers a truely generous free tier with a pretty easy installation process.

A blog post of mine is available [at](https://blog.akbuluteren.com/blog/mongoatlas-express-starter)

## Docker

Docker is a tool that allows developers to create, deploy, and run their applications by using the power of containers. Containers provide developers all the packages and dependencies to make their application run on a sandboxed environment. Unlike a VM a container doesn't contain its own kernel, it uses the host OS's resources.

Further information about the can be found [here](https://www.docker.com/why-docker)

A blog post of mine is available [at](https://blog.akbuluteren.com/blog/docker-quick-start) as a beginner's tutorial.

A blog post of mine about containers in general available [at](https://blog.akbuluteren.com/blog/what-is-a-container)

## Replit

"A "Repl" at Repl.it is an interactive programming environment. You can create a workspace in most popular programming languages, where you are given a container on a virtual machine where your code can run."

In my opinion Replit is an awesome tool for trying out stuff online with many programming languages online without having to install anything on your local.

A blog post of mine that is using Replit is available [at](https://blog.akbuluteren.com/blog/ai-powered-discord-bot-tutorial)

A detailed Replit tutorial is to be published soon.

## Colab

The part below is from Colab's official docs. Colab is really cool for many purposes, I'll, from time to time, publish posts with by using colab.

"What is Colaboratory?
Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs."

A blog post of mine that is using Colab for making GPT-2 is available [at](https://blog.akbuluteren.com/blog/gpt2-colab-tutorial)

## Netlify

Most people are using the word "Hosting Provider" while describing the Netlify, even though hosting options of Netlify are great, I find that description extremely incomplete. I can describe Netlify as a web development platform with many "modern" solutions to needs of a "modern" developer.

A blog post of mine is available [at](https://blog.akbuluteren.com/blog/why-netlify-is-my-go-to-choice)

## Heroku

"Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. Our platform is elegant, flexible, and easy to use, offering developers the simplest path to getting their apps to market."

The definition above comes directly from Heroku's own [website](https://www.heroku.com/about) and I think that's enough for a rough explanation of what Heroku really is.

## ngrok

ngrok is a tool that enables developers to expose their local development environment to Internet with as little effort as possible. ngrok works cross platform and it publishes your wish of choice at a subdomain of ngrok.com.

[Official website](https://ngrok.com/)

I also published a quick starter with ngrok, vscode and liveserver extension [here](https://blog.akbuluteren.com/blog/ngrok-basics-quick-start)
