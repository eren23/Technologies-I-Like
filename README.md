# Some Tecnologies I Like

I made this repo to store and share some of the technologies and tools I like. I'll upload new things here all the time. I can also create new categories and group the posts when the number of posts increased.

## ngrok

ngrok is a tool that enables developers to expose their local development environment to Internet with as little effort as possible. ngrok works cross platform and it publishes your wish of choice at a subdomain of ngrok.com.

[Official website](https://ngrok.com/)

I also published a quick starter with ngrok, vscode and liveserver extension [here](https://blog.akbuluteren.com/blog/ngrok-basics-quick-start)

## MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB is a document based NoSQL database for high volume data storing. You can check further details [here](https://www.mongodb.com/)

MongoDB Atlas is a cloud MongoDB database for scalable, modern web applications. MongoDB Atlas also offers a truely generous free tier with a pretty easy installation process.

A blog post of mine is available [at](https://blog.akbuluteren.com/blog/mongoatlas-express-starter)
