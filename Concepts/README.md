# Some Concepts I Like to Talk About

I was going to post only technologies and tools under that repository but I've decided to use my blog also to talk about some concepts. The folder name can be changed later.

## Cloud Computing

In the scope of computer science, cloud means servers that are accessed over the Internet. By using cloud computing companies can get rid of the responsibility of running servers at different levels.

Cloud computer services are provided by several big providers and learning how to choose between those apps is a topic on its own, this post focuses on "Cloud Computing Types" only.

A blog post of mine is available [at](https://blog.akbuluteren.com/blog/cloud-computing-basics)

## Containers

Containers are basically sandboxes for your applications. But what does it mean to put your application in a sandbox? Containers isolate a process to run on a host operating system, but unlike the VMs(Virtual Machines) containers do not have their own kernel and services. Containers just contain the (ideally) bare minimum of what you need for running your application.
